## Programmed by Benjamin Greenberg
Mini Project for Coding Temple

## Project Overview
This project works through advanced topics covered in Module 12 of Coding Temple's Frontend specialization. It includes English and Mandarin Chinese versions through use of the i18n framework. It also uses the useMemo and useCallback hooks to prevent unnecessary rerendeing. This project uses local and session storage to implement a log in component. It also uses redux to manage current shopping cart state between various pages and components. Lastly it begins to build off of Test Driven Development.

This project now adds a main.yml file to use Github actions to ensure all of our tests pass and then uses vercel to handle continuous deployment.
